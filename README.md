Absstract of the Bachelorthesis that resulted from this:
In the past years, ChatGPT has proven that it is capable of handling many tasks in many domains. This includes, but is not limited to, education. For education, the public discourse so far has been dominated by the possible adverse effects ChatGPT might have, as ChatGPT allows students to mask work done by AI as their own. This study is trying to show a positive application for ChatGPT that can help students improve their own work and can save educatorsâ€™ time. This paper is one of the first to compare ChatGPT and language professionals in grading essays. Although some research has been done, this study separates itself by placing a more significant emphasis on prompt engineering. Using the same criteria for both the human raters and GPT while also doing Zero-Shot prompt engineering has also not been done in this form. Furthermore, this study compares the quality of GPT3 and GPT4 to human rater and among the two models as well. By doing that, this study hopes to prove that ChatGPT can be used as an Automatic Essay Scoring system that can deliver grades that are comparable to those of human raters. With ChatGPT available to everyone, the results of this study could show educators and students alike what potential these AI systems have in their daily lives.
